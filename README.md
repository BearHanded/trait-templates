# trait-templates
## Abandoned, but made public in the event it is of interest to anyone.
This project was made for the 2014 Overwolf & Guild Wars 2 App Contest. It's intended function was to allow a user to save a build in game, and share builds for quick reference and templating. 

As the Contest deadline approached, Guild Wars 2 rehauled it's trait and build system for the introduction of specializations, and the app was abandoned. It would have required a complete rewrite and scrape of the gw2 wiki.

The app was still a worthwhile project to practice jquery.
